# E6-Awesomebooks-MR
In this project, I have restructured my Awesome Books app code. And made it more organized by using modules. I have used ES6 syntax . Refactoring of code is done and the app is functioning perfect as it was previously. The app can store books with an Author and unique Id for the book.
