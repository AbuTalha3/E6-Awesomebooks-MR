# E6-Awesomebooks-MR
In this project, I have restructured my Awesome Books app code. And made it more organized by using modules. I have used ES6 syntax. Refactoring of code is done and the app is functioning as it was previously. The app can store books with an Author and unique ID for the book. The Books can be added, and removed and the List of books can be updated accordingly. There is a contact and address page too.
